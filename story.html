  <h2>Here is the Chinese version of this story</h2>
    
     <p> She was the most beautiful and kind person in this town, and people admired this couple a lot. One day, the celestial being bumped into Hou Yi, in order to show the appreciation for him shooting the extra suns, The Queen Mother offered Hou Yi a magical pill which could help him to become immortal and powerful. However, Hou Yi loved his wife Chang Ee and his life, so he did not take it, instead, he asked Chang Ee to take care of this pill. </p>

    <p> Unfortunately, this message was heard by a man called Peng Meng. He was a selfish person, he wanted to own this immortal pill by himself. Thus, he pretended he was sick and stayed at Hou Yi's place. When Hou Yi had work to do and went out, Peng Meng threatened Chang Ee with a knife and forced her to give him the immortal pill. Chang Ee knew that once a powerful pill like this was eaten by an awful man like Peng Meng, the world was going to be in a mess. Under this situation, the first thought came to Chang Ee was to takethis pill herself, to sacrifice herself instead of the majority of people. </p>

 <p> After Chang Ee had the pill, she felt light and without gravity, she gradually began to fly, and she drifted further and further away from the earth. Due to the love between Chang Ee and Hou Yi, she stopped on the closet planet to earth-- the moon, to watch Hou Yi and think of him. Because this action of Chang Ee was very moved and generous, people wanted to give thanks for her and remember her, thus on every 15th of May, it has become a festival called the Mid-Autumn Festival when the Moon has the closest distance to earth, meaning that Chang Ee misses home too much - this is the day Chang Ee went back on earth and spent her time with Hou Yi every year.</p>
